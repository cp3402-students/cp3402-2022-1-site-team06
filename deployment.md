Describe your development and deployment workflow in enough detail that a
new team member or someone taking over the project could follow to successfully develop theme
updates locally, then test and deploy them to your staging and live sites. This should include aspects
such as project management, version control, testing and automation. Do not provide private details
like passwords.


# Deployment 

## Project Management and Teamwork

### Communication 

For communication our team mostly used Discord to organise meetings and message each 
other, however we also utilised Slack for GitHub integration to easily keep track of 
the progress our group was making via commits.

### Task Assignment and Workflow

Our group used Trello to assign tasks to members and easily keep track of the progress of each task. Trello allowed us 
to create cards for each task, and assign members to each task accordingly, then move those cards into categories 
based on their progress. 

Our group workflow involved assigning members tasks to complete, which were developed in a local environment, then as those task were completed, they were
commited to the group GitHub repository. Once certain milestones had been met, the site was tested on the staging 
site to check for errors. Once we had tested the site, we continued the local development to testing loop until our 
site was ready to be published to the final site. 

## Version Control and Local Environment

Our team used GitHub for version control, as it is the most widely used version control software and reasonably simple 
to use. 

Our team also used WAMP for local environment as our team all used Windows and it was relatively simple to setup and 
use.
