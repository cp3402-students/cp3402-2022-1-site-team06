#Theme Documentation
## A guide through the Jazz Townsville Theme: JazzArms
###_Important Aspects_

* **Header** - The sites header appears the same throughout all pages, to give a feeling of consistency. 
Which also includes the sites' navigation, page title and site title.
* **Footer** - The footer is consistent across all pages and displays the [underscores](https://underscores.me/) link.
* **Style** - The style of the site is done completely in CSS, within a [main.css file](#Important Files) however an 
extra .css file can be enqueued within the [functions.php](#Important Files) file to add different types of styling.
* **Content** - In regards to the conent of the website, we steered clear
of adding too much as we thought there is already a lot jumping out at the visitors of the site
we ended up removing, the audio clips and the radio page as it seemed a bit excessive.

##Important Files
###_Files that have been altered_
* **_main.css_** - Contains all styling and [design decisions](#Design Decisions) for the JazzArms theme.
* **_functions.php_** - Enqueues the _main.css_ file as a template.
* **_header.php_** - Adjusts the spacing of the site navigation.
* **_style.css_** - Adjusts background colour (default) and header sizing.

###_Files that can be altered_
* **_style.css_** - As a secondary .css this file can be changed to alter the 
look of certain pages.
* **_main.css_** - As the primary .css this file can be changed to alter the
look of the overall design of the website, with the ability to change every aspect.

##Design Decisions
* **Colours** - We decided to go with a darker theme to the previous website, as it 
is very basic and lacks a uniqueness about it. Our theme consists of a purple background with a
recurring image as its background as well as black blocked headers/footers. We believe these qualities
make our website distinctive and stand out.
* **Text** - We decided to have two different fonts one for the title/ heading (Berlin Sans FB)
and a seperate font for the page content (Helvetica) this is to distinguish between the two background
colours and to be easier on the eyes.
* **Goals** - The goal of the Jazz Townsville website is to drive viewers of the site towards
the club and to provide information of upcoming events, and general knowledge of the club to reccuring
members or newcomers. Our goal is to have atleast 2000 views on the website by the end of 2020.
